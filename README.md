# SCT_Trackcode_2

I developed a fully functional Stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!!

Features Implemented:
âœ… Start, Stop, Reset and Lap functionalities.
âœ… Record Lap times with realtime display.
âœ… Clean and responsive UI

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, time-based JavaScript functions, and UI/UX designs.
